## ReactClient Project

The ReactClient project is the React-based frontend of the application. It uses React Flow as the foundation for all
graph interactions and Zustand for state management. The UI is primarily built using React Aria components, styled with
Tailwind CSS. Communication with the backend is managed through React Query, and the API client is generated using
Orval.

### Running

Before running the application, ensure all NPM packages are installed by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

If there have been any changes to the endpoints in the API project, you can regenerate the API client by running:

```bash
npm run orval
```

The autogenerated API files will be located in the `src/api/endpoints` and `src/api/model` directories. Please note that
some code changes may be required to integrate the new client with the existing application logic.
